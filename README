MPLAB X is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for writing and
debugging applications for Microchip's microcontrollers and digital 
signal controllers.

If building on a 64-bit Slackware, you will need 32-bit compatibility
libraries. See the Microchip wiki for required files:

Alternately, simply follow Eric Hameleers' multilib guide:
